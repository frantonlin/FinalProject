# Floating Point Unit
Franton Lin

## Description
For this project, I would like to research and implement part of a floating point unit (FPU) using Verilog. Practically speaking, this is very useful, as many of the sciences require calculations that cannot be represented by integers or even fixed point format, e.g. calculating Avogadro's number. Technically speaking, this will build upon the ALU that we built previously in class, and will require me to fully understand the IEEE standard for floating point numbers.

To start, I will research FPU design and create block diagrams for the operations I am planning to implement. From the block diagrams, I will implement and test the design in Verilog. At the end of the project, I will present my research on FPU design, and demonstrate the working operations of my FPU implementation.
